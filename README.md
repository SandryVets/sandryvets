# Hi üëã, I'm Sandra √Ålvaro

## ‚ú®About me

My name is **Sandra √Ålvaro**. I'm 27 years old and I'm from Madrid, Spain. 

I've always liked the programming world and a few months ago I decided to make it my profession. So I want to become a FullStack developer üíª.

Right now I'm taking the *Full-stack JavaScript Bootcamp* at Undefined Academy.

### Five Linux commands I learned in the Bootcamp.
| Command  | Description | 
|----------|----------|
| *cd*      | Change directory.|
| *pwd*     | Shows you the path to the directory you are in.|
| *mkdir*   | Create a new folder with its name.|
| *ls*      | List the files in the folder where you are located.|
| *rm*      | Allows us to delete a file.|

### Two aliases that may be useful for Linux.

| Command  | Description | 
|----------|----------|
| *actualizar="sudo apt update && sudo apt dist-upgrade -y"*      | Updating the operating system.|
| *count="find . -type f* / *wc -l"*     | Counts the files contained in a directory.|
